## About

<table>
  <td>
    <tr>
      A web app built using Javascript, communicating with a MongoDB database through express. The front-end is displayed using React.
    </tr>

      The app allows the user to manage their recipes and meal planner. The user has full CRUD methods on the recipes, and they can assign them to a weekly meal planner, where they can also be managed. The app automatically updates a shopping list, sourcing the ingredients from the recipes in the planner, and consilidates it to avoid multiples of the same item.<br>
      Other functions include search and filters for easier recipe management.
